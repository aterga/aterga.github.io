The thesis consists of three parts. Part~I presents a technique for compositional reasoning about <i>set~comprehensions</i>~— aggregation expressions over heap-based data structures. Part~II extends this setting to compositional reasoning about <i>local reachability</i> properties of heap-manipulating programs. Part~III develops an automatic <i>verification debugging</i> technique that lifts SMT models to counterexample heap diagrams.",
